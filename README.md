# MERN Stack Store Project

This will be a practice project in which I create a store from scratch using the MERN stack.

The finished project will be one that utilizes the MERN stack, as well as Firebase, Redux, Stripe, Ant, and Bootstrap.

The store will have full user and admin interfaces. Users will be able to browse and purchase products, sign up for an account, and view order and shipping status. Admins will be able to update products, set up coupons and discounts, receive orders, and help users with issues such as password reset.
